This Swipper portfolio includes the app logo, beta tester feedback, and a user manual.

The app logo was crafted to build Swipper's prototype. Feedback from beta testers illustrates user interactions and identifies areas for enhancement. The user manual offers a concise introduction to the app, detailed steps on how to use it, and information about additional features.

Here's a glimpse of the application.
